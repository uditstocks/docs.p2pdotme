# For Community

## Start Here

The P2P Foundation Ambassador Program ("The Liberation Network") is a community-driven network that spreads financial sovereignty tools across emerging markets. It operates through country-level teams organized into four specialized tracks.

## Cypherpunk 2.0 Manifesto

Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence.

We the cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems. We are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic money.

**"The Liberation Network" exists to enable the following.**

- Financial sovereignty without surveillance
- Peer-to-peer systems that resist censorship
- Individuals transacting freely across borders
- Spreading the tools and knowledge of financial liberation

Participation requires no identity. Contribution requires no permission. Impact is measured by action, not affiliation.

## Principles

- **Anonymous-first.** No doxxing required at any level
- **Country-led.** Each country manages all tracks locally
- **Human selection.** "Country Leads" and "Keymasters" evaluate, not algorithms
- **Sustainable ratio.** 1 "Keymaster" per 5 "Ciphers" max
- **Cypherpunk ethos.** Privacy, decentralization, financial sovereignty

### Usage Guidelines

- Prefer **SVG** for web and digital use. Use **PNG** when SVG is not supported.
- Do not stretch, rotate, recolor, or add effects to the logo.
- Maintain clear space around the logo equal to at least the height of the logomark.

## FAQ

### Why is the token on Solana if the protocol is on Base?

The token launches on Solana to build community and network effects ahead of deploying the protocol there. Solana is the planned hub chain. The protocol is live on Base today and will expand to Solana next.

### Do I need to reveal my identity to participate?

No. The program is anonymous-first at every level.

### What is XP and how do I earn it?

XP is earned through Protocol app usage (eg. P2P.me and Coins.me) and social activity. You need 500 XP to be eligible for a "Cipher" role.

### What happens if I miss a weekly update?

One missed update triggers a warning. Two consecutive missed updates result in automatic role removal. You can re-apply through the normal process.

### Can I participate from any country?

You can join Discord from anywhere. Active tracks depend on which countries have appointed Country Leads.

### How are payments made?

All payments go directly to your P2P wallet.
